   MAC address
     A unique identifier assigned to a device on a network, usually presented as
     six groups of two-digit hexadecimal numbers, seperated by a colon, e.g.
     ``d0:73:d5:12:34:56``. The first six digits are a vendor-specific prefix
     and the remaining six digits are uniquely generated for each device.

     The LIFX vendor 6-digit prefix is ``d0:73:d5``.

   reference
     One or more devices to target when performing a task. See :ref:`interacting
     with LIFX devices <interacting_root>` for more detail.
