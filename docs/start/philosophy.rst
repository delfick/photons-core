The approach taken by Photons
=============================

Unlike most LIFX libraries, Photons thinks in terms of sending and receiving
packets onto the network, rather than providing objects that represent specific
devices

Photons provides a convenient API for working with multiple devices at the same
time and makes it easy to be efficient in getting and setting information on your
devices.

Photons makes discovery, retries, inflight limits, handling multiple replies,
and error handling as transparent as possible to get out of your way while you
achieve your goals.
